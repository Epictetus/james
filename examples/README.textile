This is the directory for contributed examples.

They should always be of the form:

<pre><code># If using the gem, replace with:
#
# require 'rubygems'
# require 'james'
require File.expand_path '../../lib/james', __FILE__

James.use_dialog do

  # You dialog definitions go here.

end

# Or with initializer.
#
class CoffeeDialog

  include James::Dialog

  def initialize coffee_type
    @coffee_type = coffee_type
  end

  # Your dialog definitions go here.

end

James.use CoffeeDialog.new('bolivian')</code></pre>

One example is the following simple one:

<pre><code># If using the gem, replace with:
#
# require 'rubygems'
# require 'james'
require File.expand_path '../../lib/james', __FILE__

class ItunesDialog

  include James::Dialog

  def initialize
    # Usually though it's a good idea to set it up lazily in the actions:
    # @setup_thing ||= Thing.new
    # @setup_thing.do_something
    #
    @setup_thing = Thing.new
  end

  hear 'My useful initial phrase' => :my_initial_state

  state :my_initial_state do

    hear 'something'                   => :next_state
    hear 'something and stay in state' => ->(){ "I am saying this but staying in this state" }
    hear 'something and stay in state, silently'

    into do
      "Say something on entering"
    end

    exit do
      "Say something on exiting"
    end

  end

end</code></pre>
